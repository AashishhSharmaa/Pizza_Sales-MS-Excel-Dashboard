##Problem Statement:

The Sales Manager has requested a thorough analysis of key indicators within our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. In addition to this analysis, the manager has specified the creation of an interactive dashboard using Microsoft Excel, allowing for real-time visualization of critical metrics. Furthermore, the manager has emphasized the need for a comprehensive report generated through Microsoft SQL, providing a structured overview of the findings.

The challenge at hand involves exploring the sales data to uncover trends, patterns, and customer behaviors that will inform strategic decision-making. The resulting interactive dashboard in Microsoft Excel should provide a user-friendly interface for dynamically understanding the data. Simultaneously, the Microsoft SQL report should offer a detailed narrative, consolidating the analytical results and recommendations for optimizing our pizza sales strategy.

This integrated approach aims to equip the Sales Manager with actionable insights derived from the analysis, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning to enhance overall business performance and drive sustained growth.
