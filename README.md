## Problem Statement

The Sales Manager has requested a thorough analysis of key indicators within our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. In addition to this analysis, the manager has specified the creation of an interactive dashboard using Microsoft Excel, allowing for real-time visualization of critical metrics. Furthermore, the manager has emphasized the need for a comprehensive report generated through Microsoft SQL, providing a structured overview of the findings.

The challenge at hand involves exploring the sales data to uncover trends, patterns, and customer behaviors that will inform strategic decision-making. The resulting interactive dashboard in Microsoft Excel should provide a user-friendly interface for dynamically understanding the data. Simultaneously, the Microsoft SQL report should offer a detailed narrative, consolidating the analytical results and recommendations for optimizing our pizza sales strategy.

This integrated approach aims to equip the Sales Manager with actionable insights derived from the analysis, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning to enhance overall business performance and drive sustained growth.

## Solution Summary

To fulfill the Sales Manager's request, I initiated a comprehensive analysis by first importing the pertinent data into Microsoft SQL. Employing a series of meticulously crafted SQL queries, I systematically extracted the requisite information to compile a detailed report. Following this, I conducted data importation, cleaning, processing, and analysis directly within MS Excel, establishing a seamless connection to Microsoft SQL Server for efficient data transfer.

Moving forward, I created a dynamic and visually compelling dashboard within MS Excel. Employing pivot tables for thorough evaluation and generation of insightful answers, I incorporated visually informative charts highlighting key metrics such as total revenue for the year 2015, along with daily and hourly sales trends. To further enhance user interactivity, I integrated a slicer enabling the examination of data for specific months. Exemplifying this functionality, data for January, April, and October was presented, providing a detailed and customizable view of our pizza sales performance throughout the specified time period.
